> It is possible to create, delete and update a reminder related to a specific day on the month. With information about the reminder, date, time, city and weather conditions service.

The goal of this exercise is to create a demo calendar application using React.

- Ability to add a new "reminder" (max 30 chars) for a user entered day and time. Also,
include a city.
- Display reminders on the calendar view in the correct time order.
- Allow the user to select color when creating a reminder and display it appropriately.
- Ability to edit reminders â€“ including changing text, city, day, time and color.
- Add a weather service call from a free API such as Open Weather Map, and get the
weather forecast (ex. Rain) for the date of the calendar reminder based on the city.
- Unit test the functionality: Ability to add a new "reminder" (max 30 chars) for a user
entered day and time. Also, include a city
